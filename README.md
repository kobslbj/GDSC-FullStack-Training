## NoteX Project workflow
1. Fork the Repository
2. Clone your fork
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
```
3. Create a new branch, for example
```
git checkout -b feat/notes-management
```
4. Make Changes and Commit
```
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature description"
```
5. Push to Your Fork
```
git push origin feature/branch-name
```
6. Create a Pull Request (PR)
* Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
* Click Compare & Pull Request.
* Select your branch as the destination branch (not the main branch, it's important!) in the main repository.
* Write a clear description and submit the PR.
7. Simple Code Review & Merge
* If everything looks good, I will merge the PR into your branch in the main repository.
8. Repeat
* Repeat the process for each new feature or task. Always create a new branch for new work.
